/**
 * Shared CSS + value-area template for the two `URLNode` views
 * (SPEC §17.120).
 *
 * The tile contract is identical across roles:
 *
 *   - **Title row** — fixed `3vh` row inherited from `tileLayoutStyles`,
 *     same vh-sized font, same `data-testid="title"` hook. Parent role
 *     overrides the colour to the bright off-white the operator's
 *     §17.42 amendment pinned for focused-panel titles; child role
 *     keeps the host's inherited colour.
 *   - **Value-area** — fills the rest of the tile and centres an
 *     `<img>` rendered with **`object-fit: contain`** (the operator's
 *     core requirement: "displays a QR code on the card (css rule
 *     for object fit: contain)"). The QR image is a PNG data: URL
 *     generated from `vm.url` via the `qrcode` npm package; the
 *     `contain` rule (vs §17.119 PictureNode's `cover` rule) keeps
 *     the entire QR code visible at any tile aspect ratio — cropping
 *     a QR code is fatal to scannability, so the spec deliberately
 *     diverges from the picture-strand precedent here.
 *   - **Warning fallback** — on QR-generation failure the per-view
 *     trips a state flag that swaps the `<img>` for a
 *     `<div class="warning-fill">` carrying the exact same DOM shape
 *     the `Computed*` tiles use when their strategy can't produce a
 *     value (SPEC §17.116) and the §17.119 PictureNode tile uses on
 *     image load failure. `.warning-fill` lives in the shared
 *     `tileLayoutStyles` so the glyph already renders huge, centred,
 *     and in a calm muted colour — no per-view CSS needed beyond
 *     declaring the class on the swap target. `data-testid=
 *     "warning-fill"` is the stable e2e hook, mirroring the Computed*
 *     + PictureNode contract so a future test that wants to assert
 *     "QR generation failed" can reuse the same selector logic.
 *
 * No timestamp: a `URLNode` is a snapshot leaf (SPEC §17.120 — the
 * domain inherits from `ValueNode<string>` rather than
 * `HistorizableValueNode<string>`), so the bottom-right corner stays
 * unused. The per-role files do not render a `<time>` element.
 *
 * No description / no inline-value editor: changing the URL is a
 * structural edit routed through the `EditNodeModal`'s `url` field;
 * the body itself is a passive viewport. Mirrors §17.119 PictureNode
 * parent-role contract.

/**
 * CSS scoped to the `URLNode` views. Adds the `<img>` sizing rule +
 * the `object-fit: contain` operator contract; everything else
 * (title row, value-area, warning-fill) is inherited from
 * `tileLayoutStyles`.
 *
 * The `.qr-img` rule pins the image to 100 % of its `.value-area`
 * parent on both axes — a bare `<img>` would size to its intrinsic
 * pixels and the contain rule would silently no-op (contain only
 * matters when the rendered box differs from the source aspect
 * ratio, which requires a fixed box). `display: block` eliminates
 * the baseline-aligned phantom descender modern browsers add to
 * inline-replaced elements; `min-width / min-height: 0` is the
 * flex-item escape hatch so the image actually shrinks below its
 * intrinsic size when the tile gets small.
 *
 * The §17.120 `contain` rule (vs §17.119 PictureNode's `cover` rule)
 * is the only CSS divergence between the two strands' value-area
 * stylesheets — every other rule is identical.
 *
 * `image-rendering: pixelated` keeps the QR's hard-edged modules
 * crisp when the browser scales the data: URL PNG up to fill the
 * tile (the QR is generated at 256 px regardless of the tile size,
 * and browsers default to bilinear smoothing which smears the
 * module edges and hurts scannability on lower-end cameras).
