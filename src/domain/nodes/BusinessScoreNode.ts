/**
 * `BusinessScoreNode<T>` — v4 concrete range-bounded historicised node
 * with a single goal-point Objective (SPEC §17.76; mirrors
 * `class BusinessScoreNode~T~ { +LenientRange~T~ range;
 * +Objective~T~ objective }` in the v4 class diagram, with
 * `RangedValueNode~T~ <|-- BusinessScoreNode~T~` inheritance and
 * composition edges to LenientRange<T> + Objective<T>).
 *
 * v4 successor to v3's `BusinessScoreCardNode` — different name (note
 * `Card` infix in v3), so NO `V4` suffix; ships under its v4-final name.
 * Inherits the full 5-layer abstract chain (Node → ValueNode →
 * HistorizableValueNode → RangedValueNode → BusinessScoreNode); pure
 * "binding leaf" with NO method overrides — picks the range type,
 * exposes objective, behaviour comes entirely from the chain.
 *
 *   - **`range` narrowed to `LenientRange<T>`** via TS `declare` — type
 *     only, storage stays on the parent slot. Lenient because business
 *     scores legitimately fall outside their display corridor (stretch
 *     above max, dip below min); record-keeping accepts verbatim,
 *     `requireValue` is a no-op per §17.71. `range.contains(v)` still
 *     answers truthfully — the gate is opt-in, not silent rejection.
 *
 *   - **`objective: Objective<T>`** as public `readonly` per the
 *     `*-- "1" Objective<T>` composition edge. Mandatory (a score node
 *     without a goal is a category error). v3 stored it on a separate
 *     `BusinessScoreCard` companion (`BusinessScoreCardNode.card`); v4
 *     hoists it onto the node directly, dissolving the v3 Card layer.
 *
 * Concrete (not abstract per the diagram): public constructor, clients
 * `new BusinessScoreNode<T>(...)` directly.

   * 7 (Sonar S107 limit). The options object is mandatory because
   * `objective` itself is mandatory.
   *
   * **Retirement history**:
   *   - **§17.99b** dropped the `eligibleForParentComputation` option key
   *     (the §17.93 band-aid sister of `computed`). The v5 round-7 D4
   *     successor `ValueNode<T>.disabled` (landed at §17.99a) replaces it
   *     with broader semantics; the §17.81 v3-bridge adapter now
   *     translates v3 `eligibleForParentComputation: false` to a
   *     post-construction `setDisabled(true)` call on the produced v4 node.
   *   - **§17.99c** dropped the `computed` option key (the §17.93 band-aid
   *     itself). The v5 round-7 polymorphic resolution lands the proper
   *     `ComputedBusinessScoreNode<T>` (extends BSN, §17.98); the §17.81
   *     v3-bridge now type-substitutes v3 `computed: true` BSCs to the new
   *     subclass directly instead of producing a flagged BSN. The
   *     `computedValue` aggregation switches its computed-detection
   *     predicate from `node instanceof BusinessScoreNode && node.computed`
   *     to `node instanceof ComputedBusinessScoreNode` — same observable
   *     behaviour on every live data shape, polymorphic resolution.
   *   - The `unit` band-aid still stays (retires when cards are wired
   *     into the read path; defers to §17.99d / Phase C extension).
